# Human-Activity-Recognition-using-LSTM-
This project uses an LSTM neural network to classify human physical activities from smartphone sensor time-series data. It demonstrates deep learning for motion recognition using accelerometer features from the UCI HAR dataset. Applications include fitness tracking, rehabilitation monitoring, and wearable-based health activity detection systems.
